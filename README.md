## Description:

Our aim is to construct an RNN (recurrent neural network) model to predict stock prices given time series stock price data.

## Vignette Abstract:

This vignette intends to introduce its audience to the concept of a recurrent neural network (RNN) and build upon that knowledge by providing an application of an RNN by using one to predict the stock price of the S&P 500 index. The goals of this vignette are threefold. Firstly, it aims to build a recurrent neural network model that uses the sequential/time series S&P 500 data to predict future prices. Secondly, it will outline the structure of a recurrent neural network model, explaining how its architecture and training process is different than standard feed forward networks. Lastly, it will compare performance and architecture of the RNN against other predictive models including a feed forward network, as well as SARIMA time-series model.
